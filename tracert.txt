I don't have direct access to a network, and I cannot execute commands or interact with specific systems, including using `ping` or `tracert` to check connectivity or list processes on your network. However, I can guide you on how to perform these tasks using common commands:

### 1. Check Connectivity with Ping:

- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Use the `ping` command followed by the IP address or hostname of the system you want to check. For example:

    ```bash
    ping <IP_address_or_hostname>
    ```

    If you see successful replies, it means you have a connection to that system.

### 2. Trace Route with Tracert (Windows) or Tracepath (Linux/Mac):

- For Windows:

    ```bash
    tracert <IP_address_or_hostname>
    ```

- For Linux/Mac:

    ```bash
    tracepath <IP_address_or_hostname>
    ```

    These commands will display the route taken to reach the destination system.

### 3. List Processes Using Ports for TCP Protocol:

- On Windows, you can use the `netstat` command:

    ```bash
    netstat -ano | findstr :<port_number>
    ```

    Replace `<port_number>` with the specific port number you're interested in.

- On Linux/Mac, you can use `lsof` or `netstat`:

    ```bash
    lsof -i :<port_number>
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    netstat -an | grep <port_number>
    ```

    Again, replace `<port_number>` with the specific port number.

These commands will show you processes that are currently using a specific port on your system. Note that on Linux, you might need to run these commands with elevated privileges (using `sudo`) to see all processes and their details.

Remember to replace `<IP_address_or_hostname>` and `<port_number>` with the actual IP address or hostname and port number you are interested in. If you encounter any issues or have specific questions, feel free to ask for further assistance.
